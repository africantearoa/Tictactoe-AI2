# Tictactoe-AI2

An optimal play AI for tictactoe using python 3.5 with a recursive DFS and MinMax
Select your team using capital X or O
Then use the numpad to choose the move (7,8,9 for the top row, 4,5,6 for the middle row, 1,2,3 for the bottom row)

Not a particularly clean code but it works - putting it up in case it helps anyone
